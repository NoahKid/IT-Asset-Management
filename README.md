IT Asset Tracking & Data Management
üìä Structured IT Asset Inventory System Using Microsoft Excel

Project Overview
This project involves building a structured IT asset tracking and lifecycle management system using Microsoft Excel. The system allows efficient monitoring of hardware and software assets, from requisition to retirement, using data validation, automation, and reporting techniques.

Key Features & Tasks Performed
1Ô∏è‚É£ Built a Structured Asset Inventory System
Created an Excel spreadsheet to manage IT assets efficiently.
Defined essential columns for asset tracking:
Category (Laptop, Desktop, Server, etc.)
Manufacturer (Dell, HP, Apple, etc.)
Model & Serial Number
Purchase Date & Warranty Expiry
Assigned User/Department
Status (In Use, Under Maintenance, Retired, etc.)
Location (Office, Data Center, Remote, etc.)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Implemented Data Validation & Drop-Down Lists
Used Data Validation to standardize input fields and reduce errors.
Applied drop-down lists to enforce consistent asset categorization.
Ensured every row follows a structured format for easy reporting.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Conditional Formatting for Warranty Tracking
Applied Conditional Formatting to highlight expired warranties.
Used formulas to color-code assets based on their status:
Red for expired warranties.
Yellow for assets under maintenance.
Green for active assets.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Developed an Asset Lifecycle Workflow
Added a Status column to track assets from Requisition ‚Üí Purchase ‚Üí In Use ‚Üí Retired.
Integrated a Retirement Date column for phased-out assets.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Created PivotTables for Reports & Data Filtering
Built PivotTables to generate insights, such as:
Total assets by category and status.
Assets nearing warranty expiration.
Breakdown of assets by location & department.
Used filters to quickly find assets based on specific criteria.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Removed & Managed Blank Data Entries
Identified and corrected (blank) values in PivotTables.
Used Find & Replace and TRIM() functions to clean data.
Applied conditional formatting to highlight missing entries.
7Ô∏è‚É£ Ensured Scalability with an Auto-Expanding Table
Converted the asset list into an Excel Table for dynamic updates.
Enabled automatic updates in PivotTables when new assets are added.
üîó Technologies Used
‚úÖ Microsoft Excel (Data Validation, PivotTables, Conditional Formatting)
‚úÖ Excel Formulas (TODAY(), TRIM(), IF(), etc.)
‚úÖ Data Filtering & Sorting for efficient asset management
